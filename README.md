# React Redux Example (Todo List)

This repo is a note for learning React and Redux.

Using the example from ReduxJS Documentation.


## Reducers

### State tree

```javascript
{
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_ALL',
  todos: [
    {
      text: 'Consider using Redux',
      completed: true,
    },
    {
      text: 'Keep all state in a single tree',
      completed: false
    }
  ]
}
```

### Things you should never do inside a reducer:

* Mutate its arguments;
* Perform side effects like API calls and routing transitions;
* Call non-pure functions, e.g. `Date.now()` or `Math.random()`.

### Other remarks

Note that each of these reducers is managing its own part of the global state. The `state` parameter is different for every reducer, and corresponds to the part of the state it manages.

## Store

### The store has the following responsibilities:

* Holds application state;
* Allows access to state via `getState()`;
* Allows state to be updated via `dispatch(action)`;
* Registers listeners via `subscribe(listener)`;
* Handles unregistering of listeners via the function returned by `subscribe(listener)`.

## Data Flow

Redux architecture revolves around a **strict unidirectional data flow**.

## Usage with React

### Presentational and Container Components

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th></th>
            <th scope="col" style="text-align:left">Presentational Components</th>
            <th scope="col" style="text-align:left">Container Components</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">Purpose</th>
          <td>How things look (markup, styles)</td>
          <td>How things work (data fetching, state updates)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">Aware of Redux</th>
          <td>No</th>
          <td>Yes</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">To read data</th>
          <td>Read data from props</td>
          <td>Subscribe to Redux state</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">To change data</th>
          <td>Invoke callbacks from props</td>
          <td>Dispatch Redux actions</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <th scope="row" style="text-align:right">Are written</th>
          <td>By hand</td>
          <td>Usually generated by React Redux</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>
